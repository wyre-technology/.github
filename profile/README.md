# Why WYRE?
WYRE Technology was founded to solve a very specific problem. Our region—Chattanooga, Tennessee, and the surrounding areas—had few managed services providers (MSPs), and none had emerged as the clear choice for modern businesses. There was a serious need for a team with technical depth, a broad skill set, and amazing customer service.

Cofounded by Mike Wade, Tyler York, Lee Behar, and Dave Baughn, WYRE leverages extensive experience in the IT industry with a focus on security, monitoring, management, and communication.

We want to empower businesses like yours through technology. To do that, we take the time to vet products in every category, from industry giants to new players carving out market share. The tech industry is extremely dynamic, and we've capitalized on starting fresh to bring a set of cutting edge, yet mature offerings that enable your staff and support your business.
